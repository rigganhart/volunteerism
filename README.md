This site is being buit with Angular and NodeJS.

the Endpoints used will be:


a users route:

an Events route; 
this will track all events ever submitted. it will provide: event id,event name, location, who posted, date, organization, number of volunteers needed, and a description of the event.


These routes are planed to be used by two services that will be accesed by three(or more) controllers to display data to multiple views.

User Experiance:
a User will be able to login, if they are not a user they will be propted to create a new user. Upon logging in, they will be able to see all available events and signup for events they wish to volunteer for, and see what events they have signed up for. They will also be able to navigate to thier own user page where they can view thier events they have posted, POST new events, Update current events, and DELETE old events.
